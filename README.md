[**jfjelstul/worldcup**](https://github.com/jfjelstul/worldcup)

The Fjelstul World Cup Database is a comprehensive database about the FIFA World Cup created by Joshua C. Fjelstul, Ph.D. that covers all `21` World Cup tournaments (1930-2018). An update with data on the 2022 World Cup in Qatar will be available soon. The database includes `27` datasets (approximately 1.1 million data points) that cover all aspects of the World Cup.


[**JaseZiv/worldfootballR**](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR)

This package is designed to allow users to extract various world
football results and player statistics from the following popular
football (soccer) data sites:

- FBref
- [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com/)
- [Understat](https://understat.com/)
- [Fotmob](https://www.fotmob.com/)

Since the release of `v0.5.3`, the library now supports very rapid
loading of pre-collected data through the use of `load_` functions.

The data available for loading is stored in the `worldfootballR_data`
repository. The repo can be found
[here](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR_data).

1. Acquire data from transfermarkt website using the [trasfermarkt-scraper](https://github.com/dcaribou/transfermarkt-scraper).
2. Build a **clean, public football (soccer) dataset** using data in 1.
3. Automatate 1 and 2 to **keep these assets up to date** and publicly available on some well-known data catalogs.

## ⚽ Football Culture & Fan Experiences

A companion section for the human, community-driven side of the sport. Football — especially at the non-league level — is also a community experience. Documenting these traditions alongside data resources serves the project's open-source, community-driven ethos.

### The "3 A's" of Non-League Football

| | Non-League | Premier League |
|---|---|---|
| **Affordability** | £5–£15 tickets; ~£300 for 20 away | £30–£70+ tickets; £1,500–£3,000+ |
| **Accessibility** | Walk-on gate, 20 min before kick-off | Book ahead; 45+ min queues |
| **Atmosphere** | Intimate, authentic, family-friendly | Commercial, corporate, distant |

**The full research document** ([`NON-LEAGUE-MATCHDAY-CULTURE.md`](NON-LEAGUE-MATCHDAY-CULTURE.md)) covers 13 core traditions, fan sentiment quotes, cost comparisons, top away days, community discussion platforms, and a curated reading list.

### 13 Core Match Day Traditions

| Tradition | Description |
|---|---|---|
| The Pub Signal | Pre-match pub gatherings where the community converges |
| Intimate Grounds | Small terraced stadiums (500–5,000) with pitchside proximity |
| Freedom of the Terrace | Open standing, change ends at half-time, no barriers between you and the pitch |
| The Clubhouse/Social Club | Volunteer-run canteen/bar, £2–3 pints, fans mingle as equals |
| Pie, Mash & Gravy ("Footy Scran") | £3–4 legendary local bakery pies; every penny to the club |
| Physical Programme | £2–3 paper collectables supporting club finances |
| Volunteer Spirit | Community-owned operations; the chairman knows your name |
| Local Rivalries | Deep-rooted geographic derbies with generational history |
| Chants & Songs | Organic, locally-written, multi-generational songs |
| Family Inclusion | Kids roam free, £7 family tickets, welcoming atmosphere |
| The Conference Legacy (1979–2004) | Community-over-commercialism founding ethos |
| Non-League Day | Annual open-doors events during international breaks |
| Post-Match Socialising | Clubhouse stays open well beyond full-time (4–6 hour rituals) |
