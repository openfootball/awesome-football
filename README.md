[**jfjelstul/worldcup**](https://github.com/jfjelstul/worldcup)

The Fjelstul World Cup Database is a comprehensive database about the FIFA World Cup created by Joshua C. Fjelstul, Ph.D. that covers all `21` World Cup tournaments (1930-2018). An update with data on the 2022 World Cup in Qatar will be available soon. The database includes `27` datasets (approximately 1.1 million data points) that cover all aspects of the World Cup.


[**JaseZiv/worldfootballR**](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR)

This package is designed to allow users to extract various world
football results and player statistics from the following popular
football (soccer) data sites:

- FBref
- [Transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com/)
- [Understat](https://understat.com/)
- [Fotmob](https://www.fotmob.com/)

Since the release of `v0.5.3`, the library now supports very rapid
loading of pre-collected data through the use of `load_` functions.

The data available for loading is stored in the `worldfootballR_data`
repository. The repo can be found
[here](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR_data).


[**dcaribou/transfermarkt-datasets**](https://github.com/dcaribou/transfermarkt-datasets)

this project aims for three things:

1. Acquire data from transfermarkt website using the [trasfermarkt-scraper](https://github.com/dcaribou/transfermarkt-scraper).
2. Build a **clean, public football (soccer) dataset** using data in 1.
3. Automatate 1 and 2 to **keep these assets up to date** and publicly available on some well-known data catalogs.

and identifiers across datasets. Data is downloaded when needed and cached
locally.
